myArray+=(5 6 8)

Array Key-Value
declare -A myArray
myArray-([name]=Garv [age]=21)
echo "${myArray[name]}"

lenght=${#myVar}
upper=${x^^}
lower=${y,,}
replace=${myVar/World/Buddy}
slice=${myVar:6:11}

read <var_name>
read -p "Your name" Name




Arithmetic Operations

==	-ep/==
>=	-ge
<=	-le
!=	-ne/!=
>	-gt
<	-le




Conditional Statement

If-Else
if [[ $marks -gt 40 ]]

fi

until [ //condition ]
do
	//statements
done

while true
do 
	//statement
done

While Loop to Read a csv file
while IFS="," read f1 f2 f3
do
	echo $f1
	echo $f2
	echo $f3
done < file_name.csv

cat myfile.csv | awk 'NR!=1 {print}' | while IFS="," read f1 f2 f3 			#this skips the first header line




Functions

What are functions?
-> Block of cod which perform some task and run when it is called.
-> Can be reuse many times in out program which lessen our lines of code.
-> We can pass arguments to the method
